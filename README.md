# Anarchy

Anarchy disables error checks for tools in a way that the errors are not shown at all.

This mod allows you to place vegetation and props (with DevUI 'Add Object' menu) in buildings, nets or areas.

This mod allows you to place vegetation such as trees and bushes close together.

For consistency within the community, please do not use the term Anarchy to mean something else for CSL2.

## Dependencies
[Unified Icon Library](https://thunderstore.io/c/cities-skylines-ii/p/algernon/Unified_Icon_Library/)

[BepInExPack](https://thunderstore.io/c/cities-skylines-ii/p/BepInEx/BepInExPack/)

## Detailed Descrption
The mod also has: 
* Optional Tool icon
* Keyboard shortcut (Ctrl+A)
* Optional flaming chirper
* Option to automatically enable with bulldozer
* Optional mouse tooltip
* Icons for game manipulation and bypass verification for bulldozer.

Currently it applies to these tools:
* Object Tool
* Net Tool
* Area Tool (Can exceed limits for specialized industry areas)
* Bulldoze Tool (Option to default Anarchy to ON when activated)
* Terrain Tool (Cross the line within playable area.)
* Upgrade Tool
* Line Tool from [Line Tool Lite](https://thunderstore.io/c/cities-skylines-ii/p/algernon/Line_Tool_Lite/) by Algernon

You can activate anarchy with the keyboard shortcut "Ctrl+A" or with the optional tool icon that only appears while using the above tools.

You can tell anarchy is active using optional Flaming Chirper, the tool icon, or a tooltip.

There is an option to "Permenently Prevent Override". This applies to trees and props previously placed with Anarchy. 
If you later interact with these objects with this option on, and Anarchy off, then the object will persist.
If you later interact with these objects with this option off, and Anarchy off, then the object will be overriden per vanilla.
When drawing buildings, nets, or areas the trees and props that are not prevented from overriding, will behave per vanilla.

The following errors will not occur while Anarchy is enabled:
* Overlap Existing
* Invalid Shape
* Long Distance
* Tight Curve
* Already Upgraded
* In Water
* No Water
* Exceeds City Limits (This provides Cross the line Functionality)
* Not On Shoreline
* Already Exists
* Short Distance
* Low Elevation
* Small Area
* Steep Slope
* Not On Border
* No Groundwater
* On Fire
* Exceeds Lot Limits (Editor Only)

If you find an error that you think should be added or if you find a tool that this should also be included, please let me know. 

## Disclaimer
This mod does NOT allow you to do everything including:
* Use the net tool to draw a bridge through a sea-lane clearance
* If the vanilla net tool would remove an existing network, it will still do that.
* Even if the mod disables the error check, the UI may still prevent you from doing something like placing a second copy of a unique building/upgrade.
* Does not give additional control for prop placement.

**Please save frequently, in multiple files, and learn to use responsibly.**
