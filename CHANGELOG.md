# Anarchy-BepInEx Change Log
## Patch V1.3.1
* Fixed drawing power poles with anarchy enabled causing terrain deformation below them.
* Fixed NetCompositionData for newly built networks while using Anarchy.
* Fixed CTD when trying to relocate owner building while placing building upgrades/extensions/subbuildings.

## Update V1.3.0
* All bulldozing aspects of the mod have been forked over to a new mod called Better Bulldozer.
* While using the net tool Anarchy will now let you violate the clearance of other networks. You should however avoid zoning under low bridges, but there is a new setting to help if you insist.
* Fixed accidentally adding the PreventOverride component to vehicles, cims, households, events, and buildings. This caused issues for parked vehicles getting stuck in a loop and not able to leave the stall. This version should remove all of the improperly added components and not add new ones to those types of entities.
* Fixed plugin data
* Updated Logo
 
## Patch V1.2.2
* Added trees and plants back into query for PreventCullingSystem.

## Patch V1.2.1 
* Fixed vanilla Trees not being overriden by spawning growables. (Note if you add a prop with anarchy conflicting with a standalone prop that wasn't placed with Anarchy, the standalone will be overriden).
* Added some additional checks for JS functions.
* Added a single frame delay after trying to execute the ui.js file for the first time.
